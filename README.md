```

### File Descriptions

#### Core Implementation Files

- **`01.cpp`**: The main C++ source file containing a fundamental programming exercise demonstrating pointer concepts and memory address manipulation. This file implements a basic program that explores pointer arithmetic and memory address printing.

- **`01`**: Compiled binary executable generated from the C++ source file, demonstrating the build process and executable creation.

#### Data Files

- **`input.txt`**: Contains structured input data with numerical sequences:
  - First line: Two integers (4, 5) representing parameters or dimensions
  - Second line: Sequence of odd numbers (1, 3, 5, 7, 9)
  - Third line: Sequence of even numbers (2, 4, 6, 8, 10)
  
  This suggests the program may be designed to process and manipulate different types of numerical sequences or perform operations on structured data sets.

- **`output.txt`**: Generated output file containing memory addresses in hexadecimal format (e.g., `0x16b54eb68`). The consistent memory address output indicates pointer-based operations and memory management exercises.
